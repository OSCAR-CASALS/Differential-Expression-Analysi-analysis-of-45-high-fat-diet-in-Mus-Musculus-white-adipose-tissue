@article{Han2019,
   abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

   abstract = {Motivation: Fast and accurate quality control is essential for studies involving next-generation sequencing data. Whilst numerous tools exist to quantify QC metrics, there is no common approach to flexibly integrate these across tools and large sample sets. Assessing analysis results across an entire project can be time consuming and error prone; batch effects and outlier samples can easily be missed in the early stages of analysis. Results: We present MultiQC, a tool to create a single report visualising output from multiple tools across many samples, enabling global trends and biases to be quickly identified. MultiQC can plot data from many common bioinformatics tools and is built to allow easy extension and customization.

We present a method named HISAT2 (hierarchical indexing for spliced alignment of transcripts 2) that can align both DNA and RNA sequences using a graph Ferragina Manzini index. We use HISAT2 to represent and search an expanded model of the human reference genome in which over 14.5 million genomic variants in combination with haplotypes are incorporated into the data structure used for searching and alignment. We benchmark HISAT2 using simulated and real datasets to demonstrate that our strategy of representing a population of genomes, together with a fast, memory-efficient search algorithm, provides more detailed and accurate variant analyses than other methods. We apply HISAT2 for HLA typing and DNA fingerprinting; both applications form part of the HISAT-genotype software that enables analysis of haplotype-resolved genes or genomic regions. HISAT-genotype outperforms other computational methods and matches or exceeds the performance of laboratory-based assays.},

   abstract = {We present Rsubread, a Bioconductor software package that provides high-performance alignment and read counting functions for RNA-seq reads. Rsubread is based on the successful Subread suite with the added ease-of-use of the R programming environment, creating a matrix of read counts directly as an R object ready for downstream analysis. It integrates read mapping and quantification in a single package and has no software dependencies other than R itself. We demonstrate Rsubread's ability to detect exon-exon junctions de novo and to quantify expression at the level of either genes, exons or exon junctions. The resulting read counts can be input directly into a wide range of downstream statistical analyses using other Bioconductor packages. Using SEQC data and simulations, we compare Rsubread to TopHat2, STAR and HTSeq as well as to counting functions in the Bioconductor infrastructure packages. We consider the performance of these tools on the combined quantification task starting from raw sequence reads through to summary counts, and in particular evaluate the performance of different combinations of alignment and counting algorithms. We show that Rsubread is faster and uses less memory than competitor tools and produces read count summaries that more accurately correlate with true values.},

This enables a more quantitative analysis focused on the strength rather than the mere presence of differential expression.

During that time, our resources, services and tools have continually evolved in line with both the publicly available genome data and the downstream research and applications that utilise the Ensembl platform. In recent years we have witnessed a dramatic shift in the genomic landscape. There has been a large increase in the number of high-quality reference genomes through global biodiversity initiatives. In parallel, there have been major advances towards pangenome representations of higher species, where many alternative genome assemblies representing different breeds, cultivars, strains and haplotypes are now available. In order to support these efforts and accelerate downstream research, it is our goal at Ensembl to create high-quality annotations, tools and services for species across the tree of life. Here, we report our resources for popular reference genomes, the dramatic growth of our annotations (including haplotypes from the first human pangenome graphs), updates to the Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP), interactive protein structure predictions from AlphaFold DB, and the beta release of our new website.},
